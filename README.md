## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- I have learned about universal selector and border box.
- And also max-heigth and min-heigth properties.

Here are some code snippets, see below:

```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
body {
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_max-height.php) - This helped me for understanding abour max-height. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_box-sizing.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS box sizing. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
